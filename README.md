# INDA exercise repo

### About this Repo

Welcome to the INDA exercise repo! Here you will find material for all the courses we will go through during your first year at KTH.

This main repo contains recourses for programming in general, and some for the courses in particular. It also contains repos for each course, starting with DD1337 and adding more courses as we go along.

The course repos contain repos for each exercise, with a corresponding code challenge for that week. More info can be found in the actual course repos.
