# Task 1: Java Basics

In this exercise you should implement the methods in the classes, in the following order:

1. `HelloX.java`
1. `BasicCalculator.java`
1. `AdvancedCalculator.java`

In `BasicCalculator.java`, try changing the `num1` to `9` and see what happens when you run `divide()`. What happens and why?

Feel free to ask if you get stuck or if something is unclear!
