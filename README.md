### About This Repo

Welcome to Örn's INDA course repo! Here you will find material for all the courses we will go through during your first year at KTH. 

This main repo contains
- a big picture [overview of the courses](#overview-of-the-courses),
- some [info about the exercises](#info-about-the-exercies), and
- [recourses](#recources) that you might find useful.

It also contains exercise repos for each course, starting with DD1337 and adding more courses as we go along. These exercise repos contain coding challenges for each week. More info about each course can be found in the corresponding course repos.

### Overview of the Courses

The first year consists of these four courses:

| Code | Name | Timeframe (approximate) | Description | 
|------|------|---------------------------|-------------|
| `DD1337` | [Programming](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD1337?l=en) | P1| Basic programming introduction in Java |
| `DD1338` | [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD1338?l=en) | P2 | Fundamental datastructures, and how to manipulate them |
| `DD1396` | [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD1396?l=en) | P3 | Programming that does different things "at the same time"  |
| `DD1349` | [Project in Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD1349?l=en) | P4 | Freely chosen group project, done in pairs |

### Info About the Exercies


The exercises are divided into two hours as follows:

| Description | Time |
|-------------|------------|
| Academic quarter | 15 min |
| Hour 1 | 45 min |
| Break | 15 min |
| Hour 2 | 45 min |

The first hour starts with [academic quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_quarter_(class_timing)) (meaning that if the schedule says the exercise starts at 15:00, the effective start time is 15:15). Here you will be given some time to discuss the weekly task in smaller groups, and then one or two of the groups will present their solutions.

The second hour starts with a 15 minute break. After the break you will be given a coding challenge to build on what you have learnt that week. At the end of the hour we will take a peek at what will be coming up next week.
